Libros de música para vihuela, 1536-1576

A web-based remake of the old CD catalog by Gerardo Arriaga et al. It also includes music pages from the "Ramillete de flores" manuscript (1593). Old images have been replaced with new higher resolution versions from Biblioteca Nacional de España, where appropriate.
