Libros de música para vihuela

This website is based on the electronic catalog published on CD-ROM: "Libros de Música para Vihuela 1536-1576" (edited by Gerardo Arriaga, Carlos González and Javier Somoza). Old images have been replaced with higher resolution versions from Biblioteca Nacional de España and other libraries, where appropriate. Three additional manuscript sources are included: Ramillete de flores MS, Simancas MS, A-Wn Silva de sirenas MS.
